## Gas Efficiency Optimization Strategies for `ProposalContract`

Optimizing a Solidity smart contract for gas efficiency involves minimizing state changes, reducing the amount of stored data, and simplifying logic where possible. In our  `app_original.sol`, we can apply several strategies to make it more compact and potentially reduce gas costs:

### Remove Redundant Data
- If certain data can be derived or isn't necessary for contract execution, consider removing it. For example, `current_state` could be calculated on-the-fly rather than stored.

### Optimize Data Types
- Use the smallest data types possible for your variables to save on storage costs. For example, if the expected number of votes isn't large, consider using `uint8` or `uint16` instead of `uint256` for vote counts.

### Use Mappings for Vote Tracking
- Instead of storing an array of voted addresses which grows linearly with the number of voters, consider using a mapping to track if an address has voted. This reduces the cost of lookup and storage.

### Simplify Logic
- Combine similar conditions and remove redundant checks where possible to reduce the complexity and size of functions.

### Optimize Modifier Usage
- Ensure modifiers are used efficiently and only when necessary to avoid redundant checks.

### Key Changes
- Removed the `voted_addresses` array in favor of a `voted` mapping to track if an address has already voted, optimizing storage and access.
- Removed the `current_state` variable from the `Proposal` struct since its value can be derived from the vote counts when needed, reducing storage costs.
- Simplified the `vote` function logic to directly increment vote counts and evaluate the proposal's active state.
- Used modifiers to enforce function execution conditions, streamlining function logic.

These modifications aim to reduce gas costs by optimizing storage and execution paths. However, the exact impact on gas costs will depend on how these optimizations interact with the Solidity compiler and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) during contract deployment and execution. Always test changes thoroughly to ensure they behave as expected and to evaluate their impact on gas costs.

## Function Usage Summary

### Deploying the Contract
- Deploy the contract to the network using your chosen development environment, such as Remix or a deployment script with Truffle or Hardhat.

### setOwner
- The `setOwner` function is used to transfer ownership of the contract to a new address. Only the current owner can execute this function.
- **Usage**: Call `setOwner` with the new owner's address as an argument. The transaction must be initiated from the current owner's account.

### createProposal
- The `createProposal` function creates a new proposal in the contract. It is restricted to the owner of the contract.
- **Usage**: Call `createProposal` with a description of the proposal and the total votes needed to end the voting process.

### vote
- The `vote` function allows an address to cast a vote on the current active proposal. Each address can only vote once per proposal.
- **Usage**: Call `vote` with the choice as an argument (e.g., `1` for approve, `2` for reject, `0` for pass).

### isVoted
- The `isVoted` function checks if an address has already voted on the current proposal.
- **Usage**: Call `isVoted` with the address you wish to check. It returns `true` if the address has voted, otherwise `false`.

### getCurrentProposal
- The `getCurrentProposal` function retrieves the details of the current proposal.
- **Usage**: Call `getCurrentProposal` without any arguments to get the details of the most recent proposal.

### getProposal
- The `getProposal` function fetches the details of a proposal by its ID number.
- **Usage**: Call `getProposal` with the proposal ID number as an argument to retrieve its details.

### terminateProposal
- The `terminateProposal` function is used to end the current proposal before the total votes to end are reached. It is restricted to the owner.
- **Usage**: Call `terminateProposal` without any arguments to end the current active proposal.

Please note that the `vote` function will fail if the proposal is not active or if the address has already voted. Similarly, the `createProposal` and `terminateProposal` functions can only be called by the owner. Always test these functions thoroughly to ensure they behave as expected.
